## Getting Started

### Installing

First, you need to install Node on your machine, then it is time to download and install MySQL. Open a terminal and clone the current project. To be able to start the project successfully, node_modules should be installed, to install modules you can run "npm i" from terminal to install all dependencies.
dependencies must be installed on both backend and frontend folders. then you have to enter MySql detail into the SERVER_HOST, for example for testing environment you should change these with your configutation:
<br/> SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1 <br/>
PORT=3001 <br/>
DB_HOST=localhost <br/>
DB_PORT=3306 <br/>
DB_USER=root <br/>
DB_PASS=123 <br/>
DB_NAME=test <br/>
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 <br/>
PUBLIC_PATH=public/ <br/>

### Installation steps
* Install Node
* Install MySQL
* Clone the project
* Perform NPM install in backend/frontend folders
* Connect your database   

### Executing program

* How to run the program
After successfully build node_modules for backend/frontend. navigate to the backend folder and start server with "node .\index.js".
to start frontend navigate to the folder "frontend" and use the command "npm start"

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
